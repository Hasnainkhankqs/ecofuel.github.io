                    HHO gas is a unique product based on the discoveries and patent work of Professor Yull Brown in the late 1960's. He discovered (in contradiction to the conventional wisdom of the time), that it was indeed possible to create a unique electrolyzer that could separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms out of water, WITHOUT separating them into different tanks. Prior to this, the common misconception by experts, was that the hydrogen and oxygen should NEVER be allowed to join together after electrolysis). 

                        The gas, he created, was tested and found to increase the combustion efficiency of engines, could be used for welding torches with large enough generators, and was easily made. Unlike pure hydrogen (H2), the new gas (dubbed "Brown's Gas at the time) could NOT be compressed and stored for long periods in a tank. It needed to be used immediately for best results.
                        
                        His discovery was ground breaking, and he spent the latter years of his life and a fortune ( I believe around $30 million dollars) trying to convince the general public of its great properties, but suffered from a lot of censorship and lack of media desire for coverage (Much like today). Thankfully, we have the internet and youtube, which has allowed an explosion of experimenters and tinkerers around the world to advance and share the technology, and how it can be applied to the modern car. When we started in 2008, there were a few demo videos and three other companies willing to manufacture by hand. We are among the oldest manufacturer of these hydrogen kits today. 
                        
                        Our HHO kits electrolyze the hydrogen and oxygen atoms directly out of the water, without separating them, creating a unique and energetic form of gas containing H, O, H2, O2, and even H2O. The gas is filtered, then injected into the air intake of the vehicle, where it mixes along with the air and gasoline (petrol) or diesel fuel of the car. The hydrogen-oxygen gases blend with the normal l fuel inside the engine, and upon combustion, rapidly ignite acting as a "combustion catalyst" , making the fuel burn faster, more thoroughly, and much cleaner. The HHO gas upon exploding, simply reverts back into water in microseconds, which then turns into superheated steam, cleaning the inside of the engine of carbon deposits and sludge. Since the gas causes the existing fuel to burn faster and more complete, there is LESS waste, and the energy is extracted where it matters most- inside the engine. This is why it results in extra mileage, better engine response, and lower emissions- by increasing combustion efficiencies. Remember that todays engines, with all the engineering advances, are still only about 18-21% efficient (depending on who you talk to), so just increasing the combustion efficiency a few percent makes a HUGE difference in mileage and emissions, and is why we see the results Without violating any Laws of Thermodynamics in the process (sorry guys - there is no free energy in what we are doing - just good physics).
                        
                        Hydrogen burns very fast at 40,000 feet per second vs. gasoline which burns 1/10 of that at only 4000 fps. The clean and fast burning hydrogen (66% of the hho gas) along with the 33% pure oxygen; burns the hydrocarbons in the gasoline or diesel fuel, faster and cleaner, extracting more energy out in the same amount of time. So instead of wasting that energy during a partially incomplete combustion (requiring catalytic converters and other smog removal items to chemically alter the emissions), you extract it where it matters most- inside the engine. That is why mileage goes up, and emissions drop drastically. We have even seen some engines run a few degrees cooler while using it.</p>
